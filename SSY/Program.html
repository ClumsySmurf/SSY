        <p class="p1">Program</p>
        <p class="p1">Sing Song Yoga™ is a kids’ musical yoga program in which song lyrics instruct children how to get into the poses. Deb Weiss-Gelmi is a yoga instructor and school teacher who has produced a uniquely enchanting and effective yoga video and App for kids. By singing her instructions in rhyme, with her lovely voice, she makes everything easy to follow and remember. Real kids, from preschool to grade school, work with her on each pose. Both the beautifully produced video and the completely customizable App are a wonderful resource for families, schools, after-school and health programs, promoting relaxation, control, strength and flexibility.</p>

        <p class="p1">Developer</p>
        <p class="p1">Deb Weiss-Gelmi is an elementary school teacher, a yoga instructor, and a mom. Therefore, she knows what kids love: music and movement. She teaches children to read with songs and motions, so creating Sing Song Yoga™ was a natural progression into teaching children the delight of yoga.</p>
        <p class="p1">Deb fell in love with yoga in 2001 and has continued to study with dedicated teachers since. She finds it deeply rewarding to guide her students from their first experiences with yoga through to a deeper understanding of yoga and themselves.</p>
